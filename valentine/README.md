### Step 1: Add Your Photo
Replace the photo in `surprise.html`:

2. Open `surprise.html` in a text editor
3. Find this line: `<img src="her-photo.jpg" alt="My Valentine" class="photo">`
4. Replace `her-photo.jpg` with your actual photo filename

### Step 2: Customize the Message
Edit the message in `surprise.html`:
1. Open `surprise.html` in a text editor
2. Find the section with class `message-container`
3. Edit the messages to personalize them for your loved one

### Step 3: Open the Website
Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser!

## How It Works
1. First page asks "Will You Be My Valentine?"
2. Each time they click "No", the "Yes" button gets bigger!
3. The "No" button text changes to encourage them to click "Yes"
4. When they click "Yes", confetti explodes and they're taken to a beautiful surprise page
5. The surprise page shows their photo with a lovely message

## Tips
- Test the website before showing it to them!
- Make sure your photo file is in the same folder as the HTML files
- You can change the colors in the CSS files if you want different themes
